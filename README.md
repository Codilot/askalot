# README
Askalot is a basic demo chat application for web developers or non techs that need some advice at web dev projects. The core functionality of the app is that experts give advice to users in a lower level in experience. After registration or login a user can define his experience level. The expert level is key to what chat partner you can chat with. Expert Developers can chat with all users that are online. Newbies, Junior and Senior Developers can only chat with Experts. At login the status of each user is toggled online by a green color around the gravatar. So a user can immediatly see who is available for a chat. When a new message is sent the conversation panel collapses open at the receivers screen. When a user has the conversationpanel minimised, the color of the panel header turns blue when he receives a new message in this conversation.
